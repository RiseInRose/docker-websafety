Diladele Web Safety in Docker (non clustered)
=============================================

This project is the attempt to run Diladele Web Safety in one docker container. Squid, Web Safety, SQLite and Apache - everything lives in one container. For more correct approach with one application per container see https://github.com/diladele/docker-cluster.

For the short description see http://docs.diladele.com/tutorials/docker/index.html
